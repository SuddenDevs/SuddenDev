      <p> <strong>SUDDEN_DEV is a co-op survival game with a twist - you aren't the player!</strong>
      <br>
      Write scripts to manipulate a character and work together to slay violent geometric primitives.
      Prove your genius by defending the gloriously circular <i>core</i> from the pointy anatomy of your enemies.</p>

      Play by scripting:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Scan the environment for enemies and powerups</li>
        <li>Control your character's movement</li>
        <li>Message other characters</li>
        <li>Attack enemies!</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Clearing stages will require not only smart scripts, but novel team strategies.
      You won't survive on your own.</p>

      <div class="alert alert-info">
	<strong>Development in progress!</strong>
	<p>It might be early days, but we have somehting playable and we would <i>love</i> for you to give it a spin and tell us how it goes.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Documentation a bit confusing?</li>
		<li>Ideas for gameplay?</li>
		<li>Just want to tell us that we've made a horrible game?</li>
	</ul>
