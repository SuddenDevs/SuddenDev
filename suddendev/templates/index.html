      <h3>About</h3>
      <p> SUDDEN_DEV is a co-op survival game with a twist; you don't play.
      Each player writes a script that controls their character.
      The aim of the game is to clear all the waves and protect the <i>core</i>.</p>

      Scripting lets you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>See everything near your character</li>
        <li>Control your character's movements</li>
        <li>Message other characters</li>
        <li>Attack enemies that are in range</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Clearing stages will require not only strong AI but clever team strategies.
      How effectively your characters play roles and communicate with each other will be vital.</p>

      <p>Currently, SUDDEN_DEV is in very early in development. You can check the code out
      on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/SuddenDevs/SuddenDev">here</a></p>
