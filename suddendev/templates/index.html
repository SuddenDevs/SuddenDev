      <h3>About</h3>
      <p> SUDDEN_DEV is a co-op survival game with a twist - you aren't the player!
      Write scripts to manipulate a character and work together to slay violent geometric primitives.
      Prove your genius by defending the gloriously circular <i>core</i> from the pointy anatomy of your enemies.</p>

      Play by scripting:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Scan the environment for enemies and powerups</li>
        <li>Control your character's movement</li>
        <li>Message other characters</li>
        <li>Attack enemies</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Clearing stages will require not only smart scripts, but novel team strategies.
      You won't survive on your own.</p>

      <p>Currently, SUDDEN_DEV is in very early development. You can check the code out
      on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/SuddenDevs/SuddenDev">here</a></p>
